# Presenters and Decorators: A Code Tour
by Mike Moore

## Presentation

Presenters should ease pain…don't use them if you don't have pain.

http://github.com/amatsuda/active_decorator - ActiveDecorator

* sounds like magic decorators…why not use extend

ActiveModel::Serializer – finds magic class names

Mediator Pattern vs. Decorator Pattern – take a look at the Gangs of Four

## Takeaway

Don't be afraid to create Classes that are not descended from /Active::\w+/

Tell, Don't Ask principle re-read and formulate vs. Show, Don't Tell

Posit: Does Ruby's ability to have methods suffixed with ? increase the overworking of Query

Move Conductor to ActiveDecorator…it's not ideal, but would greatly help…maybe
